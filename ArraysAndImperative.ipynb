      "# Arrays and Imperative Programming in Haskell\n",
      "\n",
      "We will be discussing arrays, a fundementally imperative structure, as well as programming in the imperative style in general. While these might not be very idiomatic to the language, Haskell implements them and makes (some versions of) them quite usables.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Arrays\n",
      "\n",
      "We are all familiar with arrays from other, imperative, languages. They are data structures - containers - the elements of which we can access in $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ (actually $\\theta(1)$). Unlike lists, however, they are not recursive structures. The best we can get with recursion are Sequences, based on finger trees, that have a time complexity ranging from $\\theta(1)$ to $\\theta(\\log n)$. We need to look elsewhere.\n",
      "\n",
      "We can divide arrays offered by Haskell into four broad categories. They are given here, with an array belonging to each pair.\n",

      "These are hardly the only representatives of these classes. There also exist:\n",

      "* DiffUArray (Immutable Unboxed)\n",
      "* StorableArray (Mutable Unboxed)\n",
      "* **STArray** (Mutable Boxed)\n",
      "* **STUArray** (Mutable Unboxed)\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference between immutable and mutable arrays in quite simple - one cannot change an immutable operator, but can only create a new instance. This does not hold for mutable arrays - we can freely set values. You might, however, notice that our representative mutable array is wrapped in IO. This is because mutating values is *clearly* impure and has to be wrapped. A similar thing occurs with the STArray family, but they are not wrapped in IO, but in something called ST.\n",
      "\n",
      "The difference between boxed and unboxed arrays is a bit more subtle. The easiest way to explain them is probably by comparing them to C arrays. We can compare *Boxed* arrays to C arrays of pointers. The \"elements\" have a constant size - the size of a pointer - no matter their actual size, like `void*[]`. However, there is also the overhead of boxing and unboxing them. The *Unboxed* arrays can be compared to C arrays of primitives like `char[]` or `int[]`. We don't have to bother with boxing and unboxing at all and that makes them a lot more efficient.\n",
      "\n",
      "So, why would we *ever* use boxed arrays?\n",
      "\n",
      "Well, quite simply, we can only put some types in unboxed arrays. Specifically, only plain values of fixed size like Int, Char, Bool, ...\n",
