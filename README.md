A repository holding miscellaneous items for the PUH (Programming in Haskell) FER UNIZG course

## Arrays and Imperative Programming

The file contains a notebook with notes and materials for the second TA lecture held during the midterms, on the topic of arrays in Haskell and imperative programming using the `IO` and `ST` monads. It contains a brief introduction to these topics, with accompanying examples.

The file presented is an **IHaskell** notebook. If you do not have IHaskell installed, you can view it using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org "nbviewer"). You can view the notebook directly by following [this link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Tweety-FER/puh-ta/blob/master/ArraysAndImperative.ipynb).

## Introduction to Applicative Functors

The **Applicative** file is an **IHaskell** notebook containing an introduction to applicative functors (the `Applicative` data type) using `Functor` and `do` notation. You may want to read it before reading the introduction to Parsec.

If you do not have IHaskell installed, you may view it using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org "nbviewer"). To view it directly, follow [this link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Tweety-FER/puh-ta/blob/master/Applicative.ipynb)

## Introduction to Parsec

The file contains an IHaskell notebook on the topic of Parsec. It gives a brief introduction to the Parsec parser combinator library, primarily based on examples. It uses `Applicative` syntax, so do check that out - you might want to read the **Applicative** tutorial featured above.

The file presented is in an **IHaskell** notebook. If you do not have IHaskell installed, you can view it using [nbviewer](http://nbviewer.ipython.org "nbviewer"). You can view it directly by following [this link](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/Tweety-FER/puh-ta/blob/master/Parsec.ipynb).
